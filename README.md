# zipcodes

Fairly simply script that was made to retrieve lat, lon from a zipcode.
The data itself may be incomplete

I retrieved the csv from opendatasoft (full-zips.csv)

Changes to the full-zips.csv
  Added some zip codes that I found were missing to the data
  Remove a trailing comma in each line, including header line which was resulting in
    an empty key/value pair when reading the csv into python.
  Rename the DST flag to "DST_Flag" from "Daylight savings time flag", which seemed
    an odd name for a fieldname value to me.

In either event:

coords_from_zip returns a tuple containing (lat,lon)

get_all_data returns the following in a dict:
  Zip:        The zip code
  City:       The city
  State       The state
  Latitude:   The latitude
  Longitude:  The longitude
  Timezone:   Timezone difference from UTC
  DST_Flag:   Not sure what this is, maybe if the location observes DST,
              I've only observed 1's and 0's here, so this makes sense
  geopoint:   a comma-separated string value representing the geo point of (lat,lon)
  
Run as __main__ for testing/demo and enter the zipcode you are searching for when prompted.
